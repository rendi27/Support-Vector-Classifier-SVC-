Machine Learning to predict Trainee Employee Perform or Not by using Support Vector Classifier model

Application of SVC machine learning model with python in the case of trainee employee performance. This is done to get insight data in employee development in the HR world. Where trainee employees who have worked for more than 1 year are used as train data to get the best model from SVC. the data used in this programme is dummy data that has been adjusted for the weight of each variable.

The final result shows the accuracy of the model 97%, this is due to our accuracy in determining the variable weights and also tuning the SVC model so as to get the best parameter values in this model.
